						My name is Bernard Williams and for the past 16 years I managed the delivery of software solutions to large organizations.

						I am a Program Manager for The Experience Engine where I manage the delivery of ground breaking technology to a large cruise line.  Before joining The Experience Engine, I was a Program Managaer with the Justice & Public Safety practice with Microsoft. There, I supported the delivery of complex solutions to public safety organizations. Prior to this, I was the Director of Professional Services with Toptech Systems (an IDEX business unit), Directed the Professional Services for NCR's Travel Self-Service business in North America, and was a Manager of Program Management with Motorola’s Public Safety Software Applications business unit.

					<div class="sideBarHeader">My Favorite Quote</div>
					<p>
						“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”
